# FIR-Filter-Verilog
A simple FIR filter with configurable coeff count.
It is written in SystemVerilog and has an assertion based testbench. The coefficients can be loaded into the rom using a simple .txt file. The design is tested on Altera Cyclone II FPGA in conjunction with a UART module and serial communication.
Datapath and Controller schematics are included in the docs folder.
